1. Get code:

git clone git@github.com:fbusabiaga/fluam
git checkout quasi2D

Edit file fluam/bin/MakefileHeader, you have to
add the correct path to HydroGrid in the variable
SRC_HYDROLIB (at the top of the file)

and choose GPU architecture

2. Go to fluam/bin
If on Courant machines do
source loadmodules.sh
and then
make

3. Go HydroGrid/fluam2d and run example

../../fluam/bin/fluam data.main

When you run the attached example, it will produce a number of files. Here is a description of some of them:

1. If you want to see what the density of green particles looks like when averaged along the x axes, i.e., rho_green(y), you can use, for example

list=""; for i in 00 02 04 06 08 10; do list="$list -block Quasi2D.000${i}000.means.inst.dat -bxy 1:6"; done; xmgrace $list &

This shows how much mixing has occurred by the end. For the red particles, see column 7 instead of 6.

2. You can also see 2D plots of the density of particles in visit (which will be very noise because few particles around):

/bin/ls Quasi2D.*.snapshot.vtk > Quasi2D.visit

Then open Quasi2D.visit in visit and make pseudocolor plot of variable Scalar1 (=rho_green) or Scalar2 (=rho_red) and watch movie

2. Too see the spectrum as a function of kx, which is the most important thing for us, use:

# green-green correlation
xmgrace Quasi2DProj.000{02,04,06,08,10}000.S_k.pair=2.Re.dat -log xy -world 0.01 0.01 1 10

These spectra are averaged over 2000 fluam steps, computing spectra every 4 steps (so total of 500 spectra). They are still noisy due to the small sample and short run but they clearly show the giant fluctuations.

To you look at the spectrum of the total density rho=rho_red+rho_green, change pair=2 to pair=1. This won't show giant fluctuations. Just red particles is pair=3, and cross-correlation red-green is pair=4 -- both show giant fluctuations but pair=4 is negative (unlike uncorrelated walkers where pair=4 would be zero).

Note that for an ideal gas with no correlations, the theoretical result is S(k)=rho_av, where rho_av is the average number density in the plane. So for S_k.pair=2 the value for uncorrelated walkers is rho_green_av = N_green_particles/volume, and for S_k.pair=1 the value for uncorrelated walkers is rho_total_av = N_total_particles/volume.

4. This also records dynamic structure factors but this is not too important at present. For example, to see S(kx,t) for the 6th wavenumber kx=16*(2*Pi/L) use:

xmgrace Quasi2DProj.000{02,04,06,08,10}000.S_k_t.k=16.Re.dat

but to really compute this accurately in this example one needs to increase nSavedSnapshots in hydroGridOptions.nml since the relaxation of the small wavenumbers is very slow.
